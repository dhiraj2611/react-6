        What is an event in react ?<br></br>
        Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.
          React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.
          React events are written in camelCase syntax.
          React event handlers are written inside curly braces.<hr></hr>
          What is memory leak and how to overcome ?<br></br>
          Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap(larger amount) and forget to delete it.
           disadvantage of memory leak is that it reduces the performance of the computer.
          In worst case, too much of available memory may affect to the system, and your device may stops working correctly, application fails or system slows down.
           Memory leaks are particularly serious issues for programs.
    
          To avoid memory leaks, memory allocated on heap should always be freed when no longer needed.  (freed = Mukt karne )
          so we have to write free() and in paranthesis we have to name that function whatever we want to freed.<hr></hr> 
          Do you prefer function-based or class component and why ?<br></br>
          Functional Component:-
             - A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).
             - There is no render method used in functional components.
             - Functional component run from top to bottom and once the function is returned it cant be kept alive.
             - Also known as Stateless components as they simply accept data and display them in some form, that they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.
             - React lifecycle methods cannot be used in functional components.
             - Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make them Stateful.
             - Constructors are not used.
    
           Class Component:-
             - A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
             - It must have the render() method returning JSX.
             - Class component is instantiated and different life cycle method is kept alive and being run and invoked depending on phase of class component.
             - Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.
             - React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components
             - It requires different syntax inside a class component to implement hooks.
             - Constructor are used as it needs to store state.<hr></hr>
             Explain reducer as pure function in redux?<br></br>
             pure Functions:-
               A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.
               It does not depend on any state or data change during a programâ€™s execution.
    
          whenever we dealing as a state value in React, the state value cannot be mutated directly.
          we will use redux store values as our React state and hence they cannot be directly mutated.
          To achieve that Reducers are made as pure.<hr></hr>
          Why do we use redux thunk ?<br></br>
          firstly we have to install 2 packages i.e. npm install Axios and Redux-Thunk.
          Axios: for Req to an API end points.
         Redux-Thunk: Define async action creators in our application.
         Redux Thunk Library is basically a Middleware we are applying to our redux store.
         that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.
         can be used for logging, routing, asynchronous actions, etc.
         Thunk function called with two arguments.
         1. dispatch: It is a method used to dispatch actions, that can be received by reducers
          2. getState: It gives access to store inside the thunk function.<hr></hr>
          What do you know about NPM ?<br></br>
          npm is the world's largest Software Registry.
           The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.
           Open-source developers use npm to share software.
          npm is free to use.
           npm is installed with Node.js.
           npm can manage dependencies.
           All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.
           Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.
           The content of package.json must be written in JSON.<hr></hr>
